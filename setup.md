~~This workshop is designed to be run on pre-imaged Amazon Web Services 
(AWS) instances. For information about how to
use the workshop materials, see the 
[setup instructions](http://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/setup.html) on the main workshop page.~~

This workshop is adapted to work on [CURC Alpine](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clusters/alpine/index.html) for the graduate class CM580A3 at Colorado State University. All instructions that follow apply specifically to CSU users, and were determined in April of 2023. Some of the details may change with system administration changes.

## Getting an account for CSU users


### Step 1. You must have a valid CSU NetID and Duo two-factor authentication enabled

You must have a valid CSU NetID and Duo two-factor authentication enabled to apply for an account on Alpine through CSU.

### Step 2. Using DUO and NetID to request an account

**To get started, request a CU-Boulder account.** Note that you must use DUO to authenticate through this form. In the password field, type your CSU NetID password, then a comma, then the word “push” or the DUO key generated by your device.

For example, if your password was ilovealpine and your DUO key is 123456, you would type:

`ilovealpine,push`

OR

`ilovealpine,123456`

### Step 3. Request RMACC account.

[Request form for an account on the system](https://it.colostate.edu/research-computing-and-cyberinfrastructure/compute/get-started-with-alpine/)

Follow the instructions starting at **You will then be asked to provide information about your account.** (right above the screenshot).

### Step 4. Email Verification.

You should receive an immediate, open ticket confirmation from rc-help@colostate.edu.  The account will created by the system administrator and **you'll be notified by a second email.**

Once receiving that notification, you can log in to the system

## Logging on once your account is created

There are two ways to connect and use the Alpine system. One is through OnDemand (described below) and the other is a direct ssh from your computer.

 1. https://ondemand-rmacc.rc.colorado.edu/
    - operates through tabs in web browser
    - can remember password, duo authentication 
    - graphical file browser, with upload/download options
    - file editor and terminal windows
 2. ssh from your terminal
    - `ssh -l eid@colostate.edu rc.colorado.edu`
    - sometimes it works better
    - sometimes it's the only way to get on the system
    - command line only
    - need password,push DUO every time


### OnDemand Walkthrough

## Setting up your account 

### First terminal experience 

Open an Alpine_shell and do the following **unless you're already setup with conda on Alpine**

For users who are already set up with conda, you can look at the script to see what it does. 

```
cd /projects/$USER
git clone https://github.com/Colorado-State-University-CMB/CM580A3-Intro-to-qCMB-2023 
cd CM580A3-Intro-to-qCMB-2023/10_alpine
bash setup.sh
```

This script configures conda for you and adds slurm aliases that make things easier. 

## Super computing concepts 

### Submitting jobs

A cluster computer is more complicated than just logging on to a super machine. 
It allows us to distribute our computational workload across nodes and CPUs. 

That means that all the computationally heavy work must be done in a script that is passed to a job scheduler called SLURM-the system will then distribute the work to its 10s of thousands of resources using configuration variables added to the script. 

Generally, the scripts are submitted using a command called "sbatch", like so:

```
sbatch scriptname.sh
# as opposed to 
bash scriptname.sh
```
