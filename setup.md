This workshop is adapted to work on [CURC Alpine](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clusters/alpine/index.html) for the graduate class CM580A3 at Colorado State University. All instructions that follow apply specifically to CSU users, and were determined in April of 2023. Some of the details may change with system administration changes.

## getting an account for CSU users

You must have a valid CSU NetID and Duo two-factor authentication enabled to apply for an account on Alpine through CSU.

To get started, request a CU-Boulder account. Note that you must use DUO to authenticate through this form. In the password field, type your CSU NetID password, then a comma, then the word “push” or the DUO key generated by your device.

For example, if your password was ilovealpine and your DUO key is 123456, you would type:

`ilovealpine,push`

OR

`ilovealpine,123456`

Follow the instructions starting at **You will then be asked to provide information about your account.** (right above the screenshot).
